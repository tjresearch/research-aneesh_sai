### What this repo contains
As of right now, a lot of different code. However, most useful code is currently in the stereovision_cpp directory. There is also a Unity project that was used to take the training and test images, I cleaned up the root directory a bit, but there still might be some extraneous code.

### Stereovision_cpp
This folder contains the calibration right now, and will also have the code for generating the pointcloud. The code is written in C++ and requires OpenCV to run properly, which can be done relatively easily with Eclipse and the Eclipse CDT Plugin. OpenCV must also be installed and linked properly through Eclipse, but once that is completed, Eclipse can handle the build and run commands for you.
